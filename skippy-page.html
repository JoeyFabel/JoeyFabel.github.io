            <p>
                Skippy is a very dumb dog. He can also be very hyper.
                He likes to hang around other people and sit in their lap.
                If he gets too excited, though, he will leak (he is a leaky dog).
            </p>

            <p>
                He will normally spend his days alternating between sleeping on the couch,
                sleeping on someone's lap, sleeping in his bed, and playing with his toys.
                He likes to play games, but he is pretty bad when it comes to tricks.
